# Analog-Time-Domain-Step-to-Gaussian-Shaping-Filter

<p> "Analogic Electronics" course project: theory, simulations and implementation of an analog filter that shape a relatively long step input signal into a short gaussian output signal.<br>
A common use of these types of filters is on radiation detectors where they are typically called "Shaping Amplifiers".</p>

<p>I'm sorry for the .docx and .pdf format but because of the lack of time i couldn't write it in Latex.</p>
